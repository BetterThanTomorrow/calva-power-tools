# Calva Power Tools

A VSCode extension, and [Calva](https://calva.io) companion, for Clojure and ClojureScript development that adds commands for popular Clojure libraries and tools. Including commands for dynamically loading the tool dependencies.

## Usage

1. Install the extension from the [VSCode Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=BetterThanTomorrow.calva-power-tools).
1. The commands are available from the command palette. There is a default keybinding for filtering the palette on the Calva Power Tools commands: <kbd>ctrl+shift+space ctrl+shift+space</kbd>.

There is a quick demo/howto here: https://youtu.be/GiWKX-0NqkM

### Default keybindings included

The Calva Power Tools extension generally contributes default keybindings for the commands. They are all chained on a first chord of <kbd>ctrl+shift+space</kbd>, a.k.a. the **Power Key**. Then, generally, each tool has its key, e.g. **Snitch** uses the **Tool Key** <kbd>s</kbd>. You can thus execute Snitch commands with <kbd>ctrl+shift+space</kbd> <kbd>s</kbd> <kbd>something</kbd>.

There are also default bindings for filtering the command palette on a specific tool. Generally the <kbd>ctrl+shift+space</kbd> <kbd>ctrl+shift+tool-key</kbd>. E.g. to list the Snitch commands:

* <kbd>ctrl+shift+space</kbd> <kbd>ctrl+shift+s</kbd>

## The Tools

A hopefully growing list of power tools.

### Tools-deps, add-libs

* [tools-deps](https://clojure.org/guides/deps_and_cli)

A set of commands leveraging Clojure 1.12 `add-libs`:

* **tools-deps: Load Dependencies...**: Will prompt for and load dependencies.
   ![alt text](assets/howto/tools-deps-add-dependencies.png)
* **tools-deps: Load Selected Dependencies**): Add one or more deps.edn dependencies coordinate that you have selected in the editor. E.g. if you have added it to your `deps.edn` file and want to load the dependency without restarting your REPL (or you may have some comment in the code with the dependency coordinates): Select the key-value pair(s) for the dependencies and then run this command.
* **tools-deps: Sync deps.edn Dependencies...**: Sync (load any missing)
 dependencies in `deps.edn`. Prompts for aliases.

**Tool Key**: <kbd>d</kbd>

### Clay

* [Clay](https://scicloj.github.io/clay/)

**Tool Key**: <kbd>a</kbd>

### Snitch

Snitch is inline-defs on steroids. See https://github.com/AbhinavOmprakash/snitch. Search the command palette for ‚ÄúSnitch‚Äù.

**Tool Key**: <kbd>s</kbd>

This menu screenshot is showing the default key bindings. I (PEZ) am on a Mac and can recommend binding the **Snitch: Instrument defn** command to <kbd>cmd+enter</kbd>.


### Performance

There are commands for four important tools when chasing performance gains in Clojure. For loading dependencies as well as basic usage:

**Tool Key**: <kbd>s</kbd>. Further each ‚Äúsub-tool‚Äù has a key, <kbd>c/d/p/t</kbd> for Criterium/clojure-java-decompiler/clj-async-profiler/time, respectively. Example: Loading the dependency for Criteriums is <kbd>ctrl+shift+space p c l</kbd>, to be read as **Power Tools, Performance, Criterium, Load**.

Issues and pull requests are welcome. Please see [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md)

## Adding a new command

1. Add the command name and title in [package.json](package.json).
   * The command name should be unique and follow the format `<library>.<command>`.
   * The title should be a human-readable name for the command.
   * The command should be added to the `contributes.commands` array.
2. Add keybindings for the command in [package.json](package.json) (optional).
   * The keybinding should be added to the `contributes.keybindings` array.
3. Add clojure snippets they should invoke in [src/calva_power_tools/tool](src/calva_power_tools/tool) (see [src/calva_power_tools/tool/clay.cljs](src/calva_power_tools/tool/clay.cljs) for an example).
   * Fully qualify symbols in snippets to avoid uninitialized namespace issues
4. Register them in [src/extension.cljs](src/extension.cljs) in the `activate` function.

## Development

The paved path is:

1. `npm run watch`. This starts Clojure with an nREPL server. (You can run the build task command inside VSCode).
   * Wait for it to report something like:
     ```
     nREPL server started on port 56749 on host localhost - nrepl://localhost:56749
     ```
1. <kbd>ctrl+alt+c ctrl+alt+c</kbd>. This runs the command: **Calva: Connect to a Running REPL Server in the Project**
   * It will connect the Clojure REPL, start a ClojureScript (shadow-cljs) REPL, and build the extension.
   * This will compile the extension and run the tests. Wait for the **Build+watch extension** to show that the tests have ran, and for Calva to pop up a progress dialog about starting your ClojureScript app (which is your extension in this case).
1. <kbd>F5</kbd>. This starts the VS Code _Development Extension Host_ (because configured to do so in [.vscode/launch.json](.vscode/launch.json))
   * The development extension host is a VS Code window where your extension under development is installed. You now need to activate it to actually start the ClojureScript app.
   * The extension auto-activates, **now your ClojureScript app and its REPL is started üéâ**
1. Back in the development project you will see the progress dialog go away. Because now the development project window is connected to the Development Extension Host window's REPL.
      * Now you can hack on the extension code, which will update the app in the extension host window while it is running (a.k.a. interactive programming).

An important thing to note here is the steps where you activate your extension in the development host, starting the ClojureScript repl which Calva can connect to.
